## Architecture 

## Boot
```
Spring start
Path : /Test-spring-boot 
Command Message : ./gradlew bootrun

React start
Path : /src/main/script
Command Message : npm start
```


## React
```
React and MobX together are a powerful combination. 
React renders the application state by providing mechanisms to translate it into a tree of renderable components. 
MobX provides the mechanism to store and update the application state that React then uses.
